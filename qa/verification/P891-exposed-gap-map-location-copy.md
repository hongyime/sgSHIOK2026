# P891 Exposed-Gap Map-Location Copy

Working root: `C:\sgSHIOK2026`
Machine: `Prawn-E14`
Date: 2026-08-29

## Scope

- Browser copy/test/evidence work only.
- No scoring, export, rescore, subset run, ingest, network build, deployment, public-data write, dependency install, or protected evidence rewrite.
- `pipeline/config/weights.yaml` was not modified.

## Change

The exposed-gap fallback now says:

`No map location is available for this exposed gap.`

instead of storage-oriented `No map coordinates are recorded...`.

## Commands

```text
> npm --prefix C:\sgSHIOK2026\web test -- score-card-copy.test.ts accessibility-render.test.tsx
npm notice run shiok-web@0.1.0 test
npm notice run node scripts/test-web.mjs score-card-copy.test.ts accessibility-render.test.tsx

 RUN  v4.1.10 C:/sgSHIOK2026/web

```

## FINDINGS

1. The exposed-gap fallback used `recorded` storage language where the user-facing issue is whether a gap can be focused on the map.

## DISAGREEMENTS

1. None.
