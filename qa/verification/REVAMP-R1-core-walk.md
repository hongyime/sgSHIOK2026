### Selected test output summary

```
revamp-layout.test.ts
  revamp Round 1 — map reliability (M01-M08, M10-M15)
    ✓ M05: does not call onStatusChange ready from map load event when routes present
    ✓ M04: basemap tile errors after route is visible do not erase route or text
    ✓ M10: does not snap map back after user panning — fitBounds guarded by routeFitKey
    ✓ M13: route-evidence map exposes feature counts for screenshot+count parity checks
    ✓ M11: stale request does not replace B's selection when A resolves late
    ✓ M15: fitRouteBounds uses measured padding not hardcoded 300/390px guesses
  revamp Round 1 — approved layout (O10)
    ✓ O10: weights.yaml untouched
    ✓ layout: navigation zoom/reset control removed
    ✓ layout: tagline hidden from primary UI but present in source for screen readers
    ✓ layout: identity row visible separately from the result panel
    ✓ S01-S03: search form structure and postal-only validation preserved
    ✓ W11: map shows immediately when postal loaded without a 'Show map' gate
```

## Browser checks

### Dev server

Started via `node web/node_modules/next/dist/bin/next dev --port 3001` from `C:\sgSHIOK2026\web`.
Available at `http://100.92.164.125:3001/` (Docker backend holds `127.0.0.1:3000`; loopback blocked).
Local preview URL: `http://100.92.164.125:3001/`

### Screenshots

Captured via minimal CDP harness against `http://100.92.164.125:3001/?postal=018956&debugMap=1`:

| Viewport | File | Size |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop 1440×950 | qa/debug-runs/revamp-r1/screenshots/018956_desktop_1440x950.png | 11,526 bytes |
| Mobile 390×844 | qa/debug-runs/revamp-r1/screenshots/018956_mobile_390x844.png | 7,505 bytes |

Screenshots show the **initial-load state** (identity row + centered search visible).
The route did not auto-render in time during the cold-start screenshot pass (see gap M01/M02 below).

### In-browser facts confirmed via CDP

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `#postal-search-input` present | `true` |
| Identity brand element visible | `true` |
| `.maplibregl-ctrl-zoom-in` absent (nav control removed) | `true` (noNavigationControl) |
| `mapStatus` selector found | `undefined` — selector changed with layout |
| `window.__shiokRouteDebug.routeCount > 0` | `false` — route did not load in cold-start pass |

---

## Selected-route feature counts per viewport

**Not captured** — the route did not render during the cold-start CDP pass (see M01/M02 gap below).
The `window.__shiokRouteDebug.sourceFeatureCounts` object was undefined at screenshot time.

This is a **known gap in this handback** (see below).

## FINDINGS

1. **NavigationControl removed.** MapLibre gestures (pan/wheel/pinch) and keyboard navigation remain available. No zoom/reset toolbar visible.

2. **Map readiness fixed.** `onStatusChange("ready")` is now deferred from the `load` event and only fires after `queryRenderedFeatures` confirms `shiokest-route-line` or `shortest-route-line` features are visible in the viewport. The old behaviour (reporting ready on style load only) is replaced.

3. **Stale-request catch guard added.** The `loadSelection` catch block now checks `requestId === loadSelectionRequestIdRef.current` before calling `setError`, preventing a late-resolving request A from overwriting the active selection B's error state.

4. **fitBounds padding updated.** Hardcoded 300/390 px desktop guesses replaced with layout-measured defaults (300 left, 110 top desktop; 270 bottom, 160 top mobile) plus a `fitPadding` prop for parent override.

5. **Approved layout implemented.** `identityRow` overlay (SHIOK. brand) is always visible top-left. In the no-result state, the search is centered at the top. In the result state (`searchOverlayWithResult`), the overlay becomes a 270 px floating left panel with scrollable `detailOverlay`. Mobile result state becomes a compact bottom sheet with a `sheetToggle` expand/collapse button.

6. **Tagline removed from visible UI.** The tagline `"Check how sheltered the walk to transit feels before you pick a place."` is wrapped in `className={styles.srOnly}`, keeping it accessible to screen readers and in source (existing source-string tests pass) but invisible in the primary map UI.

7. **Brand row hidden in empty state.** The `brandRow` (which carries the h1 and tagline) is `display: none` by default and shown only inside the floating result panel. This keeps the empty state clean: only identity + centered search.

8. **Mobile bottom sheet.** `sheetExpanded` state and a `▸ Walk details / ▾ Collapse` toggle are implemented. The sheet defaults to compact (key metrics visible) and expands on user action.

9. **Browser route-visible feature counts NOT captured.** The CDP screenshot pass hit a cold dev-server on a network IP; the `?postal=018956` URL param auto-load did not complete within the script's settle window. Screenshots show the correct empty/identity state but not a loaded route. This is the primary remaining gap for M01, M02, M13.

10. **M12 (cold/warm network profiling) PLANNED.** Requires a separate constrained-network test session; not part of this automated pass.

## Remaining gaps for reviewer

| Gap | Blocker | Smallest action needed |
|---|---|---|
| M01/M02 route-visible screenshot | CDP pass timed out on cold dev server via network IP | Run `npm --prefix web run dev` from a terminal not affected by Docker port conflict, load postal 018956 manually, then re-run screenshot harness or inspect visually |
| M13 feature count parity | Same as M01/M02 | Same fix — confirm `window.__shiokRouteDebug.sourceFeatureCounts.shiokest > 0` |
| M12 network profiling | Requires constrained-network setup | Out of scope for automated pass; schedule separately |
| 320 px layout | Script timed out before narrow-viewport screenshot | Visual check in browser DevTools at 320 px |
