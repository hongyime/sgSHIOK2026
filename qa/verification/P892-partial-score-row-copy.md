# P892 Partial-Score Row Copy

Working root: `C:\sgSHIOK2026`
Machine: `Prawn-E14`
Date: 2026-08-29

## Scope

- Browser copy/test/evidence work only.
- No scoring, export, rescore, subset run, ingest, network build, deployment, public-data write, dependency install, or protected evidence rewrite.
- `pipeline/config/weights.yaml` was not modified.

## Change

Partial locked-score copy now says:

`Partial locked score: shelter-map evidence may still be present, but unavailable locked-score rows count as zero in the locked scoring rule.`

The compact reason chip now says:

`Unavailable locked-score rows`

## FINDINGS

1. The partial-score note still used `score factors`, which is correct internally but less aligned with the four displayed rows users inspect.

## DISAGREEMENTS

1. None.
